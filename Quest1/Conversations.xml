                Well, hmm. You... could be suitable. Anyway, I have a particular associate, a water baron, that placed a special order with me some time ago. He's got his eye on a rather... ah... {{W|strange curio}}, shall we say.

                He's willing to pay handsomely, but I'll need someone to find it for me. What do you say, =pronouns.formalAddressTerm=, are you interested?

            <text>Ah wonderful. My associate described the curio as such, {{w|*ahem*}}:

            {{C|"A drum-like object of metal, with four flanges jutting out from its sides. A palm-sized lense of cerulean crystal rests upon each flange, and at the curio's end, a mouth-like opening lined with glittering circuitry."}}

            What this thing actually is? Your guess is as good as mine.</text>

            <text>I don't know, to be honest. Perhaps if you ask around, some {{W|tinkers}} or {{W|merchants}} may have heard of such a thing.

                Fah! If I knew where the thing was, I'd have just gone and gotten it and claimed the reward myself.</text>

                Well that certainly sounds interesting! But I have not heard of that, no.~
                =player.formalAddressTerm=, you honor me with your search for knowledge. Alas, I have heard nothing of such a device.~
                No. I have not. Live and drink, wayfarer.~
                Unfortunately, that object is completely unfamiliar to me. Good luck in your search.

            <text>A few years back, a couple of fellers came through, treasure hunters they were. A bit frazzled, said they come from one of them {{W|rust wells}}, out east of Red Rock. Said they was looking for lost artifacts down deep when they ran across some {{W|fearsome beast}} and hightailed it right back up.

            They tried to get a hunting party together to go back, but I don't think they ever did. But one of them did say he caught a glimpse of that monster's hoard and described an object kinda like what you said.</text>
